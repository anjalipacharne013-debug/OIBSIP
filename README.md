This repository contains three front-end web development tasks showcasing my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. The first task is a Restaurant Landing Page, designed to highlight a modern layout and responsive UI. The second task is a Personal Portfolio Website that presents my projects, skills, and contact details in a clean and professional format. The third task is a Temperature Converter, a simple yet functional tool that converts values between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Each project reflects my learning, creativity, and growing proficiency in web development.
